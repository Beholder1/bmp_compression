# bmp_compression
Program has two main funkctions: it can convert bmp filo into wss file and wss file into bmp file.  
If we choose bmp to wss conversion, we can pick a type of our compression: dedicated palette, imposed palette or grayscale.  
After that you choose if you want dithering or not.  
At the end you pick a name of a wss file.  
If you want to convert wss to bmp, first you need to insert a name of a wss file and then pick a name for a bmp file.  
  
The exe file is in bin/Debug. It has to be in the same place as bin/Debug/SDL2.dll file
